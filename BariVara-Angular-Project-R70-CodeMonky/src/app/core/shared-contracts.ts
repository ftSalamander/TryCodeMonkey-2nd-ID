/**
 * Cross-app contract, Part 1 Phase 3.
 *
 * This file's content is identical in both projects — BariVara's copy lives here,
 * LandLord's at `LandLord-Angular-Project-R70/src/app/core/shared-contracts.ts`.
 * There's no monorepo/package link between the two (they're genuinely separate
 * deployed sites), so this is kept in sync by hand. If you change one, change the
 * other the same way.
 *
 * Two kinds of shapes live here:
 *
 * 1. Concepts that are identical in both apps today (Conversation, AppNotification)
 *    — moved here instead of staying duplicated inline in each MockDataService.
 *
 * 2. The boundary-crossing DTOs — what actually flows between the two systems once
 *    Phase 15 makes the sync real. Defining the wire shape now means Phase 15 maps
 *    each app's internal model onto/from these instead of inventing the contract
 *    from scratch under backend time pressure. Until Phase 15, nothing calls these;
 *    each app still manages its own mock data independently.
